## Description

I have a task to evaluate the board [Rock-3A](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock3/3a) from [Radxa](https://wiki.radxa.com/Home) for my upcoming projects.
The projects require the Yocto build system, but the current [meta-radxa](https://wiki.radxa.com/Yocto-layer-for-radxa-boards) does node support Rock-3A machine.

So I create a pull request to port the Rock-3A based on [Radxa's bsp](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock3/dev/Debian). Enjoy it!
